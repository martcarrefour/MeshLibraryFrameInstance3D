name="MeshLibraryFrameInstance3D"
description="`Extends the `MeshInstance3D` class. This plugin enables dynamic management of 3D meshes from a `MeshLibrary`, allowing users to switch between different mesh frames. By setting the `mesh_library` property, the plugin initializes with the available meshes and allows for frame-based switching through the `current_frame` property. It's an ideal solution for animations or any scenario requiring frame-by-frame changes of 3D models."
